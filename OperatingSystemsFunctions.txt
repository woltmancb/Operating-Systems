One function of an operating system is to manage the memory of the computer. The operating system decideds what is allowed to access the memory and how much of it can be used. So for memorty the operating sysmte mostly keeps track of all of it
Another operating system function is to turn on/start the device. The power button is used to do this and starts up the computuer.
One more function of an operating system is to manage programs on the computer. It decideds what programs can be ran and what we can do on the computuer. Some operating systems allow the users to only use one program at a time this is known as single tasking, other operating aysems all the user to run multiple programs at once and this is called multi tasking. The computuer that I am using right now allows multitasking with the operating system.
